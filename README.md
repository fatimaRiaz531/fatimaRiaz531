## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Fatima**, a dedicated and growth-oriented front-end developer with a solid foundation in modern web technologies and a growing passion for artificial intelligence.  
I specialize in building responsive, user-focused web applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and more. With a strong background in both web and Python development, I am now exploring the world of **AI**—learning to build intelligent agents using tools like **Chainlit** and **Streamlit**.

Currently enrolled in the **Governor House IT Initiative**, I’m constantly upskilling myself to stay at the cutting edge of tech, blending design, code, and logic to create meaningful digital experiences.
